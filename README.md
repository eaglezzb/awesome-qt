## Binding
* [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/) - PyQt is a set of Python v2 and v3 bindings for Digia's Qt application framework and runs on all platforms supported by Qt including Windows, MacOS/X and Linux. PyQt5 supports Qt v5. PyQt4 supports Qt v4 and will build against Qt v5. The bindings are implemented as a set of Python modules and contain over 620 classes.
* [PySide](http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide) - The PySide project provides LGPL-licensed Python bindings for the Qt. It also includes complete toolchain for rapidly generating bindings for any Qt-based C++ class hierarchies.

## Compression
* [KArchive](https://projects.kde.org/projects/frameworks/karchive) - A library for creating, reading, writing and manipulating file archives like zip and tar. It also provides transparent compression and decompression of data, using formats like gzip, via a subclass of QIODevice.

## Cryptography
* [Qt Cryptographic Architecture (QCA)](http://delta.affinix.com/qca/) - Taking a hint from the similarly-named Java Cryptography Architecture, QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API, using Qt datatypes and conventions.

## Database
* [QxOrm](http://www.qxorm.com) - QxOrm library is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for C++/Qt developers.

## Game Engine
* [Bacon2D](https://github.com/Bacon2D/Bacon2D) - Bacon2D is a framework to ease 2D game development, providing ready-to-use QML elements representing basic game entities needed by most of games.
* [V-Play](http://v-play.net/) - V-Play Game Engine allows easy cross-platform mobile game development for all major platforms including iOS, Android, BlackBerry.

## Multimedia
* [QtAv](https://github.com/wang-bin/QtAV) - A multimedia playback framework based on Qt and FFmpeg to write a player easily.

## Networking
* [libmaia](https://github.com/wiedi/libmaia) - libmaia is a easy-to-use XML-RPC library for Qt.

## Web Frameworks
* [QDjango](http://qdjango.org/) - QDjango is a web framework written in C++ and built on top of the Qt library. Where possible it tries to follow django's API, hence its name.

# Software
* [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) - Is a terminal emulator which mimics the look and feel of the old cathode tube screens. It has been designed to be eye-candy, customizable, and reasonably lightweight.
* [Tiled](http://www.mapedito.org/) - Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It is meant to be used for editing maps of any tile-based game, be it an RPG, a platformer or a Breakout clone.
